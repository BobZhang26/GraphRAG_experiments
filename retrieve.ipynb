To determine the impact  of sedation depth, the cohort was divided into two groups (the light and deep sedation).

Third, prone positioning reduces the risk  of death in patients with ARDS when it is initi- ated during the first 12 to 24 hours after the  onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS and is admin- istered for at least 16 hours per day.26 The per- centage of patients who underwent prone posi- tioning in our trial was similar to that observed  in a recent international epidemiologic study, but  it was lower than in the ACURASYS trial.5,7  Whether early continuous neuromuscular block- ade is more effective with prone positioning is  unknown, but it is a possible explanation for the  different results of our trial and the ACURASYS  trial.

It did not contribute  significantly to ICU-AW. Based on these results, NMBAs infusion is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS for its  short-term benefit in early phase of disease.
