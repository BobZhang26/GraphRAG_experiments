Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.

The results of  prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent  with those of the primary analysis across sever- ity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites  with different exclusion rates for previous neuro- muscular blockade use. Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.

The results of  prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent  with those of the primary analysis across sever- ity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites  with different exclusion rates for previous neuro- muscular blockade use. Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.
