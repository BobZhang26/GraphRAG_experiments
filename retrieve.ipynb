    "## Purpose\n",
    "The code implements an enhanced document retrieval system that combines vector similarity search with graph-based traversal to find relevant document chunks. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Search & Similarity Scoring**\n",
    " - Converts the input query into a vector embedding\n",
    " - Performs similarity search against entity nodes in Neo4j\n",
    " - Creates a sorted dictionary of entity IDs and their similarity scores\n",
    " - Filters results based on a similarity threshold (default 0.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Traversal Strategy**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    MATCH path = (n:Chunk)-[*1..{max_hops}]->(m:`__Entity__`)\n",
    "    WHERE m.id IN $ids\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Finds paths from document chunks to relevant entities\n",
    " - Limits path length to control traversal depth\n",
    " - Only considers entities that met the similarity threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relevance Calculation**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    WITH n, min(length(path)) as distance, m\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, m.id as entity_id\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, entity_id, \n",
    "            CASE \n",
    "            WHEN entity_id IN $ids \n",
    "            THEN $similarity_scores[entity_id]\n",
    "            END as similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Calculates shortest path length to each entity\n",
    " - Preserves original similarity scores from vector search\n",
    " - Combines structural proximity (distance) with semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Ordering**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    ORDER BY similarity DESC, distance\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Prioritizes chunks with higher semantic similarity\n",
    " - Uses path distance as a secondary sorting criterion\n",
    " - Ensures most relevant chunks appear first\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Format**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    RETURN n.text, n.fileName, n.page_number, n.position, entity_id, similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Returns comprehensive chunk metadata:\n",
    "    - Text content\n",
    "    - Source file name\n",
    "    - Page number\n",
    "    - Position in document\n",
    "    - Associated entity ID\n",
    "    - Similarity score\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Hybrid retrieval approach combining:\n",
    "    - Vector-based semantic search\n",
    "    - Graph-based structural relationships\n",
    "- Configurable parameters:\n",
    "    - Similarity threshold\n",
    "    - Maximum path length\n",
    "    - Result limit\n",
    "- Deduplication of chunks\n",
    "- Ordered results by relevance\n",
    "- Rich metadata for each chunk"

    "2. Example with max_hops=2:\n",

    "    (Chunk)-->(Entity)           // 1 hop\n",
    "    (Chunk)-->(Node)-->(Entity)  // 2 hops\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Use Case in the Code:\n",
    "- The query finds chunks that are connected to relevant entities either:\n",
    "    - Directly (1 relationship away)\n",
    "    - Through intermediate nodes (up to max_hops relationships away)\n",
    "- This broadens the search context while maintaining control over the search depth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Impact**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # With max_hops = 1 (direct connections only)\n",
    "    Chunk -> Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With max_hops = 2 (includes indirect connections)\n",
    "    Chunk -> IntermediateNode -> Entity\n",
    "```\n",
    "This flexibility is particularly useful in knowledge graphs where relevant information might be connected through intermediate concepts or relationships."

Discussion In this randomized, controlled, open-label trial,  the use of dexmedetomidine as the primary or  sole sedative in patients undergoing mechanical  ventilation in the ICU did not result in lower 90- day mortality than usual care. Early in the course  of the critical illness, most patients who were  treated with dexmedetomidine received supple- mental sedatives. Although the target level of  light sedation was observed more frequently in  the dexmedetomidine group, deep sedation was  frequently reported in the two groups. The num- ber of days that patients were free from coma or  delirium and the number of ventilator-free days  were 1 day more in the dexmedetomidine group  than in the usual-care group for each of the  comparisons; the confidence intervals for the  between-group differences did not include zero  but were unadjusted for multiple comparisons.</td>\n",

Discussion In this randomized, controlled, open-label trial,  the use of dexmedetomidine as the primary or  sole sedative in patients undergoing mechanical  ventilation in the ICU did not result in lower 90- day mortality than usual care. Early in the course  of the critical illness, most patients who were  treated with dexmedetomidine received supple- mental sedatives. Although the target level of  light sedation was observed more frequently in  the dexmedetomidine group, deep sedation was  frequently reported in the two groups. The num- ber of days that patients were free from coma or  delirium and the number of ventilator-free days  were 1 day more in the dexmedetomidine group  than in the usual-care group for each of the  comparisons; the confidence intervals for the  between-group differences did not include zero  but were unadjusted for multiple comparisons.    \n",

These results are in line with other recent surveys. The LUNG SAFE study, a prospective study of 459 ICUs in 50 countries conducted in the winter of 2014, found that 37   \n",

The short  duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking  agent probably explains this result. In conclusion, this multicenter trial provides  evidence that the administration of a neuromuscu- lar blocking agent early in the course of severe  ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation  may improve outcomes.

This trial  had high adherence to the protocol, including  minimal crossover use of neuromuscular block- ade and high adherence to the recommended  ventilation and fluid strategy. The results of  prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent  with those of the primary analysis across sever- ity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites  with different exclusion rates for previous neuro- muscular blockade use. Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.

Light sedation was defined by a score of 0 or −1 on  the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (scores range  from 4 [combative] to −5 [unresponsive], with a score  of 0 indicating that the patient is alert and calm), a  score of 3 or 4 on the Riker Sedation–Agitation Scale  (scores range from 1 [unresponsive] to 7 [dangerous  agitation], with a score of 4 indicating that the patient  is calm and cooperative), or a score of 2 or 3 on the  Ramsay Sedation Scale (scores range from 1   \n",

This trial  had high adherence to the protocol, including  minimal crossover use of neuromuscular block- ade and high adherence to the recommended  ventilation and fluid strategy. The results of  prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent  with those of the primary analysis across sever- ity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites  with different exclusion rates for previous neuro- muscular blockade use. Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups. Higher PEEP may itself  reduce mortality among patients with moderate- to-severe ARDS, thereby blunting the potential  treatment effect of early   \n",

This lack of blinding may have influenced short- term assessments of early neuromuscular func- tion, the level of physical activity, and the report- ing of adverse events. In conclusion, among  patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were  treated with a higher PEEP strategy, the admin- istration of an early and continuous infusion of  cisatracurium did not result in significantly lower  mortality at 90 days than usual care with lighter  sedation targets.

Background In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and de- crease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evalu- ated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in  patients with early, severe ARDS. Methods In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care  unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were ran- domly assigned to receive, for 48   \n",

However, this study was not designed or  powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits  and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscu- lar blocking agents in patients with ARDS who  were receiving lung-protective mechanical venti- lation14 require further evaluation. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, pla- cebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine  whether a short period of treatment with the neu- romuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate  early in the course of severe ARDS would improve  clinical outcomes.   \n",
