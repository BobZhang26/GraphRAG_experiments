However, the two groups did not dif- fer significantly with respect to the number of pa- tients given at least one open-label cisatracuri­um  bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment  (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The re- quired dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar  in the two groups during the first week of the  study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix). Safety Bradycardia developed during the cisatracurium  infusion in one patient. No other side effects were  reported. Discussion Treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent  cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of  severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day sur- vival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator- free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased  the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90  days   \n",

It did not contribute  significantly to ICU-AW. Based on these results, NMBAs infusion is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS for its  short-term benefit in early phase of disease.

Our hypothesis was that in patients with  microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 and moderate- to-severe ARDS, no significant difference in 90-day hos- pital mortality was to be found between populations who  received or not early NMBAs. Thus, the primary goal of  this study was to identify difference in 90-day mortality,    \n",

Third, prone positioning reduces the risk  of death in patients with ARDS when it is initi- ated during the first 12 to 24 hours after the  onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS and is admin- istered for at least 16 hours per day.26 The per- centage of patients who underwent prone posi- tioning in our trial was similar to that observed  in a recent international epidemiologic study, but  it was lower than in the ACURASYS trial.5,7  Whether early continuous neuromuscular block- ade is more effective with prone positioning is  unknown, but it is a possible explanation for the  different results of our trial and the ACURASYS  trial. Patients in our trial were enrolled earlier after  the onset of ARDS than those in the ACURASYS  trial.42 Consequently, we may have included pa- tients who might not have   \n",

However, this study was not designed or  powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits  and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscu- lar blocking agents in patients with ARDS who  were receiving lung-protective mechanical venti- lation14 require further evaluation. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, pla- cebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine  whether a short period of treatment with the neu- romuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate  early in the course of severe ARDS would improve  clinical outcomes.   \n",

First, to iso- late the effect of hypothermia, both trial groups  were treated similarly, except for the tempera- ture intervention.

In the con- servative approach, fluid intake is restricted and  urinary output is increased in an attempt to  decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of  mechanical ventilation, and improve survival.

Initial resuscitation of shock followed by a conservative late fluid management strategy  is associated with low mortality (15). An optimal fluid management protocol for patients  with ARDS would include specific protocol-directed resuscitation for shock combined with  a conservative fluid management strategy once shock has resolved. Further studies could  evaluate the combination of the FACTT Lite protocol with specific protocol-directed shock  resuscitation.

Stretch-induced lung injury may not occur if lung compliance is not greatly reduced. However, the ben- efit of ventilation with a lower tidal volume was in- dependent of the static compliance of the respiratory system at base line, suggesting that the lower tidal vol- ume was advantageous regardless of lung compliance. Variations in chest-wall compliance, which contrib- utes to compliance of the respiratory system and is reduced in many patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,39 may have obscured a true interaction between tidal volume and base-line lung compliance. Barotrauma occurred with similar frequency in the two study groups, a finding consistent with the results of other studies in which the incidence of baro- trauma was independent of airway pressures.22-24,40,41 The most common manifestation of barotrauma was pneumothorax   \n",

However, any condition  that increases the duration of neuromuscular  blockade would have adversely affected the patients  receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in  particular by increasing the duration of mechani- cal ventilation. The sample-size calculation was based on our  two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15  that used the same inclusion criteria as were used  in the current trial and on the European epidemio- logic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the  placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than  Probability of Survival 1.0 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.5   \n",

The most common reason  for exclusion was improvement in the Pao2:Fio2  before enrollment (658 patients). The most com- mon reason for exclusion after screening was  the previous receipt of neuromuscular blockade  (655 patients). Of the patients who were enrolled,  501 were randomly assigned to the intervention  group, and 505 to the control group. Baseline  characteristics were similar in the two groups  (Table  1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary  Appendix).

When sedation is administered, a light level of sedation  should be targeted utilizing daily interruptions of sedation or nursing protocols with  validated sedations scales. Avoiding benzodiazepines and deep sedation results in less  delirium, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and improved mortality.   \n",

As light  sedation inevitably results in increased spontaneous respiratory effort, further study is  needed to determine the tradeoffs between deeper sedation and spontaneous respiration,  particularly in severe ARDS.

As  an inexpensive intervention requiring no complex technology, PP is feasible across high and  middle income countries (9). However, a 2017 Canadian study showed that only 10% of  appropriate patients receive PP, and the LUNG-SAFE study found that 16% of severe cases  globally received PP (1, 3). A regional   \n",

Conclusions In adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV, as compared with  a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure, does  not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality.
