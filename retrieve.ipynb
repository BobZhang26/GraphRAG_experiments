    "## Purpose\n",
    "The code implements an enhanced document retrieval system that combines vector similarity search with graph-based traversal to find relevant document chunks. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Search & Similarity Scoring**\n",
    " - Converts the input query into a vector embedding\n",
    " - Performs similarity search against entity nodes in Neo4j\n",
    " - Creates a sorted dictionary of entity IDs and their similarity scores\n",
    " - Filters results based on a similarity threshold (default 0.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Traversal Strategy**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    MATCH path = (n:Chunk)-[*1..{max_hops}]->(m:`__Entity__`)\n",
    "    WHERE m.id IN $ids\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Finds paths from document chunks to relevant entities\n",
    " - Limits path length to control traversal depth\n",
    " - Only considers entities that met the similarity threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relevance Calculation**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    WITH n, min(length(path)) as distance, m\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, m.id as entity_id\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, entity_id, \n",
    "            CASE \n",
    "            WHEN entity_id IN $ids \n",
    "            THEN $similarity_scores[entity_id]\n",
    "            END as similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Calculates shortest path length to each entity\n",
    " - Preserves original similarity scores from vector search\n",
    " - Combines structural proximity (distance) with semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Ordering**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    ORDER BY similarity DESC, distance\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Prioritizes chunks with higher semantic similarity\n",
    " - Uses path distance as a secondary sorting criterion\n",
    " - Ensures most relevant chunks appear first\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Format**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    RETURN n.text, n.fileName, n.page_number, n.position, entity_id, similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Returns comprehensive chunk metadata:\n",
    "    - Text content\n",
    "    - Source file name\n",
    "    - Page number\n",
    "    - Position in document\n",
    "    - Associated entity ID\n",
    "    - Similarity score\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Hybrid retrieval approach combining:\n",
    "    - Vector-based semantic search\n",
    "    - Graph-based structural relationships\n",
    "- Configurable parameters:\n",
    "    - Similarity threshold\n",
    "    - Maximum path length\n",
    "    - Result limit\n",
    "- Deduplication of chunks\n",
    "- Ordered results by relevance\n",
    "- Rich metadata for each chunk"

A brief period of paralysis early in  the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective  mechanical ventilation by improving patient– ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate  adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels,  thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony- related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar- pressure increases with overdistention. Another  possible mechanism of the benefit involves a de- crease in lung or systemic inflammation.15 The main safety concern with the use of a  neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weak- ness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal  compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and ro­ cu­ron</td>\n",

A brief period of paralysis early in  the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective  mechanical ventilation by improving patient– ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate  adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels,  thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony- related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar- pressure increases with overdistention. Another  possible mechanism of the benefit involves a de- crease in lung or systemic inflammation.15 The main safety concern with the use of a  neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weak- ness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal  compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and ro­ cu­ron</td>\n",

Although the  optimal sedative agent for ARDS patients is unclear, benzodiazepines should be avoided due to  associations with oversedation, delirium, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay,  and increased mortality. Minimizing sedation in patients with ARDS facilitates early mobilization  and early discharge from the intensive care unit, potentially aiding in recovery from critical illness.

FACTT Lite was designed as an easier protocol to implement in the ICU than FACTT  Conservative. By eliminating the categories of ineffective circulation as defined by clinical  examination findings (5) and condensing the CVP ranges from four to three, the FACTT  Lite protocol had fewer rows, columns, and cells dictating instructions. FACTT Lite was  implemented as a cointervention control in ARDS Network studies in more than 40  participating hospitals, about   \n",

The short  duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking  agent probably explains this result. In conclusion, this multicenter trial provides  evidence that the administration of a neuromuscu- lar blocking agent early in the course of severe  ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation  may improve outcomes. Future studies are need- ed to replicate and expand these findings before  they can be widely adopted in clinical practice.

A brief period of paralysis early in  the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective  mechanical ventilation by improving patient– ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate  adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels,  thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony- related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar- pressure increases with overdistention. Another  possible mechanism of the benefit involves a de- crease in lung or systemic inflammation.15 The main safety concern with the use of a  neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weak- ness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal  compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and ro­ cu­ron   \n",

Abstr act Background Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has been endorsed in the guidelines of the Sur- viving Sepsis Campaign as a key strategy to decrease mortality among patients pre- senting to the emergency department with septic shock. However, its effectiveness  is uncertain. Methods In this trial conducted at 51 centers (mostly in Australia or New Zealand), we randomly  assigned patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock  to receive either EGDT or usual care.

A brief period of paralysis early in  the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective  mechanical ventilation by improving patient– ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate  adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels,  thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony- related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar- pressure increases with overdistention. Another  possible mechanism of the benefit involves a de- crease in lung or systemic inflammation.15 The main safety concern with the use of a  neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weak- ness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal  compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and ro­ cu­ron   \n",

It did not contribute  significantly to ICU-AW. Based on these results, NMBAs infusion is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS for its  short-term benefit in early phase of disease.

This trial  had high adherence to the protocol, including  minimal crossover use of neuromuscular block- ade and high adherence to the recommended  ventilation and fluid strategy. The results of  prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent  with those of the primary analysis across sever- ity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites  with different exclusion rates for previous neuro- muscular blockade use. Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.

In our trial, the higher number of cardio- vascular adverse events in the intervention group  than in the control group could be the result of  deep sedation in the intervention group, which  could have induced hypotension, bradycardia, and  other cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the use  of the lighter sedation strategy in our control  group may have decreased mortality in that  group. Third, prone positioning reduces the risk  of death in   \n",

However, there was no evidence of  benefit even when analyses were restricted to  trial sites that rarely excluded those patients. We  did not systematically measure the effect of neu- romuscular blockade on ventilator dyssynchrony.

Lower PEEP was also permitted if a pneumo- thorax developed or if the patient was at high  risk for barotrauma.

Third, prone positioning reduces the risk  of death in patients with ARDS when it is initi- ated during the first 12 to 24 hours after the  onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS and is admin- istered for at least 16 hours per day.26 The per- centage of patients who underwent prone posi- tioning in our trial was similar to that observed  in a recent international epidemiologic study, but  it was lower than in the ACURASYS trial.5,7  Whether early continuous neuromuscular block- ade is more effective with prone positioning is  unknown, but it is a possible explanation for the  different results of our trial and the ACURASYS  trial. Patients in our trial were enrolled earlier after  the onset of ARDS than those in the ACURASYS  trial.42 Consequently, we may have included pa- tients who might not have   \n",

Summary—Current evidence supports the use of protocol-based, light-sedation strategies in  critically ill patients with ARDS. Further research into sedation management specifically in ARDS  populations is needed.

Minimizing sedation in these patients should  remain an important goal to minimize delirium, increase patient mobilization, and optimize  patient recovery.40 Weaning Sed   \n",

Greater baseline shock in the FACTT  Lite group does not explain the observed increase in fluid balance on days 1 and 2 because  similar results were observed in subjects without baseline shock. One possible explanation  for these findings is lower clinician compliance with FACTT Lite than with FACTT  Conservative during the first 2 study days. At the time that the FACTT study was performed, the FACTT Liberal fluid strategy  represented the usual prior practice. Cumulative fluid balance   \n",
