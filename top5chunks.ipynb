Discussion Despite the fact that prospective clinical trials with active screening for delirium have shown that delirium occurs in 20% to 60% of critically ill patients [1-3,11-14], this retrospective review of 71 academic medical centers in the United States found that this dis- ease is only documented in 6% of critically ill patients. Therefore, a majority of delirium is either undiagnosed or the diagnosis of delirium is not being documented using ICD-9\\n5. ital mortality (8% vs. 9%, P = 0.419). Based on UHC CDB/RM hospital LOS and mortality model predictions, patients with delirium stayed in the hospital longer than expected (11 observed days vs. 10 expected days, P &lt; 0.001) but die in-hospital less often than expected (8% observed mortality vs. 12% expected mortality, P &lt; 0.001).

Discussion Despite the fact that prospective clinical trials with active screening for delirium have shown that delirium occurs in 20% to 60% of critically ill patients [1-3,11-14], this retrospective review of 71 academic medical centers in the United States found that this dis- ease is only documented in 6% of critically ill patients.
