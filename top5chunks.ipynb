The primary objective was to investigate whether neu- romuscular blockade modified the relationship between  VR and mortality in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early  Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial [35]. We tested  for the first time whether elimination of skeletal muscle  activity by neuromuscular blockade is a significant effect  modifier in the relationship between VR and mortality  in ventilated patients with moderate   \n",
